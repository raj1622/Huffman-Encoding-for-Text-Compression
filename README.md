# Huffman-Encoding-for-Text-Compression

This project implements Huffman encoding, a technique for lossless data compression. Huffman coding assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, resulting in efficient compression.

Contents
Main.java: Contains the main method to run the Huffman encoding and decoding.
HuffmanCoder.java: Implements the Huffman coding algorithm.
Heap.java: Implements the heap data structure used in Huffman coding.
